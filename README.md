# Prototype 2: Frontend UI in React with Material Design

This prototype demonstrates a React frontend with Material UI components that fetches summary data from a Flask API.

## Features

- React-based UI with Material Design components
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Fetches article and summary data from the Flask API
- Includes mock data as a fallback if the API is unavailable
- Clean separation of components for better maintainability

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` - React frontend application
  - `src/` - Source code
    - `components/` - React components
      - `Header.js` - App header with title
      - `ArticleList.js` - List of articles to select from
      - `SummaryDisplay.js` - Display for article summaries
    - `App.js` - Main application component
    - `index.js` - Entry point for React app

- Flask API (from Prototype 1)
  - `app copy.py` - Flask backend API
  - `mock_articles copy.json` - Mock article data
  - `mock_openai copy.py` - Mock OpenAI implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x with Flask

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The React app will run on http://localhost:3000 and will proxy API requests to the Flask backend at http://localhost:8888.

### Running the Backend

```bash
python "app copy.py"
```

The Flask API will run on http://localhost:8888.

## Implementation Details

This prototype focuses on:
- Frontend UI using React with Material Design components
- Fetching summary data from the Flask API
- Providing a responsive and user-friendly interface
- Handling API errors gracefully with mock data fallbacks

The application allows users to:
1. View a list of available articles
2. Select an article to view its summary
3. See summaries generated by the backend API
4. Experience a modern, responsive UI with Material Design
